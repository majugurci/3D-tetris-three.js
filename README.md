# 3D-tetris-three.js
3D tetris implemented with three.js library

This is a project made for university course computer graphics.

You can see documentation and play the game at http://rg.c-hip.net/2014/seminari/jugurcic/zaigrajTetris.html

Idea, concept and core code were taken from existing project at https://github.com/fridek/Threejs-Tetris
From the original I have added these features:
  - Selectable board size (3 sizes)
  - Increasing game speed as time passes
  - Option to pause game
  - Changed block appearence so it's now transparent
  - Changed background to dark theme
  - View box where you can see next piece (which is webGL piece, so there are two sepparate webGL pieces)
  - View box where you can see position of the heighest piece (which are images manipulated throug JS and CSS)

This was my first encounter with 3D graphics in web and I have learned a lot through working on it.
